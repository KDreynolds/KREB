	1.	Purpose and Scope:
	•	Who is this language for?
	 answer - programmers who appreciate simplicity
	•	What problems does it solve? (e.g., education, simplicity in scripting, a specific domain)
	 answer - a simple general purpose langauge - compiled and manual memory managed
	2.	Core Features:
	•	Data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, booleans).
	 answer -
	•	Control structures (e.g., if-else, for, while).
	 answer - if-else
		        for
						while
						maybe some more (probably)
	•	Functions (e.g., first-class functions, lambdas).
	 answer - no lambdas
	•	Error handling (e.g., result types, exceptions).
	 answer - errors as values
	3.	Syntax and Semantics:
	•	Define how code is written (e.g., structure, keywords, operators).
	function example:
		fx foo():
		  bar

	variable example:
	  int foo = 22;
		string foo = "string";


	4.	Rules and Constraints:
	•	Mandatory immutability for variables unless explicitly mutable
	 mandatory immutability unless otherwise noted.
	•	No enforced whitespace or minimal syntactic sugar.
	 minimal syntactic sugar.
